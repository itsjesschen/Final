# Final Project -
## By Jessica Chen

## Here are the requirements that I have included in my project

### Requirements


**1. Create a web application using the Laravel MVC framework**
: Check

**2. Use 1 REST web service **
: I used the RSS "api" to ask for files in XML format to be used in my application

**3. Used another REST service**
: I used Twitter's API to ask for files to be used in my application

**4. AJAX using jQuery **
: This can be seen when (1) Initial load of the list of Twitter and RSS Feeds (2) When asked to "show +X" more, 
:(3) When hovering over dates (4) When clicking on RSS Article Links to expand/minimize article descriptions

**5. Interactivity**
: See Above

** Other **
: I use Data validation using Laravel's Validator Class. This can be seen to validate required input (all fields), correct Twitter feeds, and uniqueness of added feeds
: I also use Database integration using Laravel's Fluent Query as well to add added feeds into the database and also to pull articles and tweets from it when requested.
